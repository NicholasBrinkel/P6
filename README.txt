cases.ss 
This file contains 10 test cases. There are comments in that file for how to load the test cases into the interpeter and use them with your myinterpreter function.

TestMyfns.scm
This is a script file you can use from the stdlinux command line (not from within the scheme48 interpreter). You will need to put this file in the same folder as your myfns.ss file and give the script execute privileges (i.e. "chmod +x TestMyfns.scm"). Then running the script will test your interpeter against the same 10 cases from cases.ss.
